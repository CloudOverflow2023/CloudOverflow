Overview
- we have many devices at home that charge throughout the day and thats it
- Problem is that the duck curve shows when there is a peak time of solar and wind energy GENERATED is during the times of 9 AM to 5:30 PM and there is nothing to load it 
- Solution is to create HARDWARE (that reads/writes load and generation) and SOFTWARE that loads devices during those times and give the ability to customers to sell their Load  (minnimum 20%) after 6 PMm (under the assumption that the power is generated through solar and wind)
    - We take data from two different datasets and compare it to a duck curve
        Data Set 1 = House Data
            -- Total House mW Capacity
            -- Total House mW Output
      
        Data Set 2 = Grid Data
            -- Time 
            -- mW
    - We try to figure out optimal time to charge, discharge, and sell based on the datasets
